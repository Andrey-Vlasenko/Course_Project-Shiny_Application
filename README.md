## Description of the Application

This application was developed to compare two linear models which were biult on the mtcars data set.
Both models are _lm(mpg~wt)_ but first model (*Model1*) uses all data points and the second (*Model2*) uses only data points from selected area

To set area for Model2 you have to select (brush) area on the plot on the 'Models' tabPanel.
